    <h2>Researching Hosting</h2>
    <div id="reflection">
      <p class="subhead">
        Researching hosting solutions was a breeze! In my previous career as a musician I had a
        number of terrible artist websites through services like wordpress and bloggerbut making use
        of GitHub’s Git Pages was really easy. Publishing my website was a matter of four command
        lines. One of the benefits of using GitHub was an increased familiarity with the platform
        where so much software development is taking place. Increasing fluency with such a popular
        from of version control is a good use of time. For throughness I did review the other
        services detailed in the assignment but they didn’t suit my needs; but Vercel uses react,
        Netlify allows integration with GitLab (a plus) but I didn’t want to create a new account,
        and I try to stay clear of Google products because of the damage they’ve done to the arts so
        FireBase was off the list.

      <h2>Testing and Validation</h2>
      <p>
        To validate user entry in forms I relied on the required and the pattern attributes. Regexes
        are a powerful tool made for exactly for this sort of use case. When combined with some
        logic in JavaScript to produce reminders for the user about which fields to fill...<br />
        eg.
        <code>if (input_value === “”) {alert(“Please input your name =^) ”};)</code> you can be
        (reasonably) sure the user knows how to satisfy the requirements of the form.
      </p>
      <p>
        To test my forms I did some research on the characteristics of the fields rather than trust
        my assumptions. I learned that postal codes cannot start with certain letters, and that the
        pattern attribute can be combined with JavaScript to protect the form inputs. Additionally,
        I tested my forms by telling my friend that I would buy them a beer if they could get a bad
        entry through after throughly testing them myself. I was confident that the form validation
        was secure as the regex expressions I used were very thorough, and having a beer on the line
        motivated me to check and double check all my inputs and attributes.
      </p>
      <p>
        My advice to other beginner web developers is to not build their websites from scratch like
        I did. Though I learned a lot from this process, ultimately I think this is like building a
        C program without using stdlib. This would be something good to do as a test to hone your
        skills but not to actually produce a finished website. Set up your template, go learn some
        cool tricks on a test website you built from scratch, and then apply what you learned to
        your template.
